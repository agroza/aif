 Preface
 ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

 Thank you for your interest in this project, be it the hardware, software,
 or both components.

 I hope you had fun building the 16-bit ISA Audio Interface and you will have
 a great time using it with any computer you might have, as long as it is
 equipped with an ISA bus.

 I decided to write this documentation for a clearer understanding of what is
 the intended purpose of the AIF program, and how to use the program.

 Considering the exhaustive hardware documentation for this project, and the
 availability of the source code, it is only natural that this document fills
 the gaps on the software documentation side of the Audio Interface project.


 Abstract
 ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

 Most sound cards require some sort of hardware initialization before being
 usable. And this is also the case for the 16-bit ISA Audio Interface that is
 mentioned above.

 This guide provides insights into the features of the AIF hardware interface
 driver. It furnishes information which readers can use to determine the best
 use-cases for their specific needs, in addition to the main scope of this
 computer program.

 1.0 Introduction

 This document provides guidance in the usage of the AIF driver to intialize
 the OPTi 82c924-based 16-bit Audio Interface sound card, model 2486-AIF-401.

 The document describes the various functionalities included with the driver,
 while also exploring the extra sub-programs.


 1.1 Audience and Scope

 This document is primarily intended for people that either have built or
 acquired the 2486-AIF-401 audio interface. In addition, this document could
 be useful to those who want to use the additional functionalities offered,
 such as the CD Player sub-program, or the EEPROM programming feature.

 The information within this document is specific in nature, and applies
 solely to the above-mentioned AIF interface driver and sound card hardware.


 1.2 How to Use This Document

 To view this document through the included text-mode viewer program, type:

   display.com manual.txt

 This document is organized into chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect
 of the AIF software. The structure is designed to help you find information
 quickly and efficiently.

   * Chapter 2 focuses on the main use-case of AIF, which is to initialize
     the audio interface hardware, including both the sound controller and
     the audio codec.

   * Chapter 3 details the additional sub-programs embedded within the AIF
     software. These include Setup, PnP Setup, (EEP)ROM Setup, Mixer, and the
     CD Player functionalities.

   * Chapter 4 provides supplementary information, that is general in nature.

 The order in which you read the chapters is flexible.
 While it is recommended to read the entire documentation for a comprehensive
 understanding, it is perfectly acceptable to consult only those sections
 relevant to your specific use-cases.


 1.3 What is AIF?

 It is an MS-DOS(R)-based commandline interface driver program created for
 the initialization of the 16-bit ISA Audio Interface sound card, which is
 based on the OPTi 82c924 sound controller chip, Crystal CS4231A audio codec
 chip, and the Yamaha OPL-3 FM synthesizer chip.

 The sound card can be initialized to Sound Blaster(tm) mode, in addition to
 the Windows Sound System(tm) mode.


 1.4 Additional Features

 A series of additional features can be controlled through the embedded Setup
 sub-program. For example, the availability of the IDE CDROM host interface,
 various IRQ and DMA settings, as well as sampling rates and bit depths.

 The AIF program includes an EEPROM access sub-program that can be used to
 read or write the 93C56 serial EEPROM, located on the printed circuit board
 assembly. This EEPROM can store a custom PnP configuration.

 There is even an audio CD player sub-program that can fully control the
 CDROM drive hardware through a text-mode graphical user interface, provided
 that the CDROM Extensions driver is already installed on the host system.



 2.0 Main Usage

 This section covers the main use-case for the AIF hardware interface driver.


 2.1 General Considerations

 In order to use the AIF software, you have to place it in its own directory,
 for instance C:\AIF, or whatever other directory suits your preferences.

 At the first run of the program, it will create an additional file, AIF.BIN
 that contains the hardware configuration for the Audio Interface sound card.

 This way, at any subsequent initialization of the sound card, the driver
 will use the stored configuration instead of going through the setup program
 again and again.

 If you use the CD Player sub-program, it will create another file, AIF.CDP.
 The CD Player configuration is stored in there.

 If any of these files are deleted, or corrupted, then AIF.EXE will re-create
 them.

 It is recommended to start AIF through AUTOEXEC.BAT, in order to automate
 the sound card initialization.

 2.1.1 System Requirements

 In order to run AIF.EXE, you need an IBM PC or compatible computer, with an
 80286 processor, and at least 80 KB of free conventional memory. However,
 100 KB is preferred. In addition, MS-DOS(R) version 3.21 is required.

 AIF is a non-resident program and frees all allocated memory upon exit.

 You also need around 27 KB of free drive space for the main executable file
 and the hardware configuration files. This User's Guide and Reference Manual
 occupies an additional 38 KB of drive space. The text viewer program takes
 less than 1 KB of drive space, and its documentation around 3 KB. In total,
 you need around 70 KB of free drive space for the entire software package.

 2.1.2 8-bit CPU Support

 By default, AIF requires a 16-bit CPU (i.e. at least an 80286). However,
 depending on a specific conditional define, 8-bit CPU instructions can be
 generated during source code compilation, effectively allowing AIF.EXE to
 run on 8088-class CPUs.

 The drawback is that the compiled program code size increases by at least
 2 KB, and the execution speed decreases. On the other hand, on such a slow
 speed CPU, this is not a big issue.

 Besides running the CD Player sub-program, 8-bit mode is not really of use,
 since the Audio Interface is a 16-bit ISA card, thus it requires a 16-bit
 CPU and a free 16-bit ISA slot.

 In practice, it is highly unlikely that an 8-bit variant of AIF.EXE should
 ever exist.


 2.2 List of Files

 For references, the following files are included, part of the AIF software
 package.

   File Name    ³ Description
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   AIF.EXE      ³ the hardware interface driver itself
   AIF.BIN      ³ stores the Setup and Mixer hardware configuration
   AIF.CDP      ³ stores the CD Player settings
   DISPLAY.COM  ³ text-mode file viewer program
   DISPLAY.TXT  ³ documentation for the DISPLAY.COM program
   MANUAL.TXT   ³ this document

 AIF.EXE is actually the only file required, as the .BIN and .CDP files are
 auto-generated, should they not exist. This MANUAL.TXT document is nice to
 have and is a good reference point in addition to the embedded commandline
 help screen. DISPLAY.COM is a lightweight text file viewer that allows you
 to view this (or any other text) document, while providing basic scrolling
 features. Its documentation is distributed as DISPLAY.TXT. Should you not
 need this file, feel free to delete it to gain around 3 KB of disk space.


 2.3 Commandline Parameters

 Simply running the executable file will tell you that you have to supply at
 least one, if not multiple parameters.

 For the record, the command line parameters are case-insensitive, which
 means that, for instance, -init is equal to -INIT.

 2.3.1 Parameter Types

 There are two types of commandline parameters, identified as follows.
   * simple
   * complex

 Simple parameters are identified by a single word, such as -help or -setup.

 Complex parameters are identified by a single word, followed by an equal
 sign, and the intended value. For example, the -lineout=on|off statement.

 2.3.2 Embedded Help Screen

 The easiest way to get information on the commandline parameters is to type
 either of the following:

   aif.exe -?
   aif.exe -help

 The following screen is displayed at the console.

 Usage is:
   aif.exe [-?|-help] [-romsetup] [-pnpsetup] [-setup] [-mixer]
     [-lineout=on|off] [-noinit|-init|-wss|-sb] [-quiet] [-cdplayer] [-status]

 Where:
   -?|-help  shows this screen; ignores other parameters
   -romsetup starts the (EEP)ROM setup sub-program; ignores other parameters
   -pnpsetup starts the PnP setup sub-program; ignores other parameters
   -setup    starts the setup sub-program
   -mixer    starts the volume mixer sub-program
   -lineout  enables or disables line out relay
   -noinit   skips the audio interface initialization sequence
   -init     initializes the audio interface to preset mode
   -wss      initializes the audio interface to Windows Sound System mode
   -sb       initializes the audio interface to Sound Blaster mode
   -quiet    reduces text verbosity
   -cdplayer starts the CD player sub-program
   -status   displays the current audio interface configuration

 Examples:
   aif.exe -init
   aif.exe -mixer -init -quiet -status

 As you can see in the examples section, multiple commandline parameters can
 be combined. For instance, to configure the card for the very first time,
 you could type:

   aif.exe -setup -mixer -init

 Please note that in order to persist the settings, you must save the Setup
 and Mixer configuration when exitting each sub-program. Otherwise, Setup
 will be automatically triggered the next time you issue the initialization
 command.

 In fact, the same will happen if you supply any other commandline parameters
 that rely on persistent settings.


 2.4 Initialization

 Upon correct initialization of the sound card hardware, LED2 (SWCFGD) should
 light up, and the output relay will pulse (audible click-clack) in order to
 filter out the eventual noises caused when setting the internal registers of
 the audio codec chip.

 The simplest way to initialize the card is to use:

   aif.exe -init

 However, two additional shortcuts are available as commandline parameters.

   Parameter ³ Description
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   -sb       ³ Initializes the card to Sound Blaster mode.
   -wss      ³ Initializes the card to Windows Sound System mode.

 Both parameters work either standalone, or in conjunction with other, but
 not together, and not combined with -init.

 In fact, AIF first checks for the -init switch, then for the -wss switch,
 and finally for the -sb switch. Thus, if you type for instance:

   aif.exe -sb -init -wss

 the same effect is realized as typing the following command:

   aif.exe -init

 To recap, the initialization commandline parameters are not to be combined.

 If the -setup, -mixer, or both commandline parameters are specified, without
 any initialization parameter, then the card has to be initialized for the
 changes to take effect.

 2.4.1 Automating the Initialization

 Once the sound card hardware is correctly configured, then the following
 line is typically sufficient within AUTOEXEC.BAT:

   aif.exe -init

 If you don't have the AIF directory referenced by the PATH variable, then
 you need to specify the fully qualified path and filename. For instance,

   c:\drivers\aif\aif.exe -init

 It is recommended that the AIF initialization statement to be put at the end
 of the AUTOEXEC.BAT content. However, the program is unlikely to interfere
 with any other drivers, thus you could place it wherever you find suitable.

 2.4.2 Keeping Quiet

 If you don't want AIF to be verbose and output a lot of text during the
 initialization sequence, while loaded by AUTOEXEC.BAT, then you can use the
 following command.

   aif.exe -init -quiet

 The -quiet parameter can also be used during normal initialization, directly
 from the commandline, but this use-case is quasi-questionable.

 2.4.3 Skipping Initialization

 An additional commandline parameter was added to skip the initialization
 sequence of the audio interface hardware. This is useful if you only need to
 run the CD Player sub-program on a machine that is equipped with a different
 sound card.

 Simply running the following command:

   aif.exe -noinit

 will cause the program to terminate immediately. Combining this -noinit with
 any other parameter than -cdplayer, will terminate the program immediately.


 2.5 Controlling the Line Output Relay

 AIF is able to control the line output relay via a complex parameter. The
 audio output can be turned on or off by using the following commands.

   aif.exe -lineout=on
   aif.exe -lineout=off

 This parameter can work either standalone, or in conjunction with the the
 other parameters. For example:

   aif.exe -setup -lineout=off
   aif.exe -setup -mixer -lineout=off

 You can execute these commands, if for some reason you need to disconnect
 the line output, even though the Setup or Mixer configuration was modified.

 In addition, -lineout internally triggers an initialization command. Thus,
 combining -lineout with -init is redundant. But, the following commands are
 still valid:

   aif.exe -lineout=on -init
   aif.exe -lineout=off -init

 However, it is unnecessary to specify -init, if -lineout is present.


 2.6 Combining Parameters

 As previously stated, multiple commandline parameters can be combined. For
 example, these commands are valid.

   aif.exe -setup -mixer -init -cdplayer
   aif.exe -setup -mixer -lineout=on -cdplayer

 The order in which commandline parameters are treated is the same as that of
 the parameters displayed in the commandline help screen.

 Please note that the -romsetup and -pnpsetup parameters cannot be combined
 with eachother, nor with any other parameter.
 AIF first checks for the EEPROM Setup sub-program switch, and then for the
 PnP Setup sub-program switch, effectively ignoring all other parameters.



 3.0 Additional Sub-programs

 For convenience, a few additional sub-programs are embedded within the main
 executable file. This way, there are less standalone .EXE files involved in
 the software package distribution.

 In addition, there is less storage space involved, meaning that the AIF
 package is lightweight. In other words, it is also suited for floppy disks.


 3.1 Which Sub-programs are Available?

 When the AIF program is compiled, some of the sub-programs could be omitted
 by conditional defines. This option exists for a number of reasons, such as.
   * reduce executable file size
   * exclude PnP Setup, which is an experimental sub-program
   * exclude CD Player, if a lightweight version of the driver is required

 The following sub-programs are always compiled in the executable file.
   * Setup
   * EEPROM Setup
   * Mixer

 The following sub-programs could, or could not be part of the compiled file.
   * PnP Setup
   * CD Player

 To know which sub-programs are available, just observe the first line output
 to the console when AIF is executed.

 AUDIO INTERFACE +PnP SETUP +CD PLAYER  VER. 3.2.536 REV. A
 Copyright (C) 1998-2025 Microprogramming TECHNIQUES

 The included sub-programs appear as +PROGRAM NAME after the AUDIO INTERFACE
 identifier.

 3.1.1 Beta Versions

 While AIF is still under development, some versions may be tagged as beta,
 meaning that they are to be treated as evaluation versions. You can use such
 a version on your own risk. However, it is recommended to keep a backup copy
 of the last known non-beta fully-functional version.

 A beta version has a specific identifier (-á) that appears immediately after
 the build number. For example:

 AUDIO INTERFACE +CD PLAYER  VER. 3.4.573-á REV. C
 Copyright (C) 1998-2025 Microprogramming TECHNIQUES

 Beta versions may contain previously unreleased features or sub-programs, or
 major refactoring of the source code.


 3.2 Setup

 The Setup program presents the hardware configuration options in an easy to
 use manner, through a text-mode user interface. This way, you can easily
 select and modify the hardware parameters of the audio interface.

 To start the Setup sub-program, type:

   aif.exe -setup

 If AIF.BIN does not exist, then regardless of what commandline parameter you
 specify, the Setup sub-program will be invoked first.

 The program commands, accessible via keyboard shortcuts are listed below.

 If any of the parameters above are modified, when pressing the ESC key, you
 will be prompted to save the changes. Alternatively, you could just press
 F10 to automatically save the changes and then exit the Setup program.

 If you opt not to save the configuration upon exitting Setup, and you have
 also passed the -init commandline parameter, then the sound card hardware
 will still be initialized with the new values, but they will not be stored
 for persistency.

 At any point, if you feel you altered the wrong parameter, you can press F8
 to load the default configuration that is guaranteed to work with the AIF
 hardware. Similarly, F9 reloads the previously stored configuration from the
 AIF.BIN file, if any.


 3.3 PnP Setup

 The purpose of the PnP Setup sub-program is to allow customization of the
 PnP EEPROM data stored on the card.

 Notes:
   * This sub-program is *not* yet fully implemented.
   * This documentation section is subject to change.

 3.3.1 Disambiguation

 PnP stands for Plug and Play. This is a set of techniques that allow the OS,
 BIOS, and hardware (in this case ISA) to automatically manage the allocation
 of system resources. The OPTi 82c924 sound controller chip supports ISA PnP.

 3.3.2 Description

 The goal of the PnP Setup sub-program is to provide a visual representation
 of the PnP EEPROM configuration data.

 Only if configured to be included at compilation time, to start the PnP
 Setup sub-program, type:

   aif.exe -pnpsetup

 If the PnP Setup is excluded when the AIF.EXE interface driver was compiled,
 the parameter is ignored, and an error message is displayed.


 3.4 (EEP)ROM Setup

 The (EEP)ROM Setup sub-program allows reading of the onboard 93C56 serial
 EEPROM, effectively dumping its contents to a given file. At the same time,
 you have the possibility to erase, or rewrite the EEPROM with the contents
 of a custom file.

 To start the EEPROM Setup sub-program, type:

   aif.exe -romsetup

 The program commands, accessible via keyboard shortcuts are listed below.

   Shortcut ³ Function              ³ Description
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   F4       ³ Edit Filename         ³ Specifies the input/output file name.
   F5       ³ Erase EEPROM (Fast)   ³ Clears the EEPROM contents quickly.
   F6       ³ Erase EEPROM (Slow)   ³ Clears the EEPROM contents slowly.
   F7       ³ Read EEPROM           ³ Dumps the EEPROM contents to a file.
   F8       ³ Write EEPROM          ³ Programs the EEPROM with custom data.
   ESC      ³ Exit                  ³ Exits the sub-program.

 The Filename field specifies either a fully qualified path and file name, or
 only the file name. In this case, the file will be written to, or read from,
 the same directory where the AIF.EXE program resides.

 The Raw Data window dynamically updates with byte data, while the EEPROM
 contents are being read. At the same time, the progress bar is updated to
 show the completion percentage of the current operation.

 For feedback purposes, the program also updates the operation and status
 fields accordingly.


 3.5 Mixer

 The Mixer sub-program provides an easy, visual way to set the sound volumes
 for the various input and output channels available on the audio codec chip.

 To start the Mixer sub-program, type:

   aif.exe -mixer

 The program commands, accessible via keyboard shortcuts are listed below.

   Shortcut ³ Function              ³ Description
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   F8       ³ Default Configuration ³ Loads the default configuration.
   F9       ³ Reload Configuration  ³ Reloads the stored configuration.
   F10      ³ Save and Exit         ³ Saves the changes (if any) and exits.
   ESC      ³ Exit                  ³ Prompts whether to save changes (if
            ³                       ³ any), and exits, depending on your
            ³                       ³ input.

 In addition, there are seven keyboard shortcuts that toggle various things.
 These commands, and their keyboard shortcuts are listed below.

   Shortcut ³ Function              ³ Description
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   1        ³ Line In               ³ Sets the line in as source input.
   2        ³ FM & AUX In           ³ Sets the OPL3 + AUX as source input.
   3        ³ Microphone            ³ Sets the microphone as source input.
   4        ³ Post-Mixed DAC        ³ Sets the PC Speaker as source input.
   5        ³ Microphone Gain +20dB ³ Boosts microphone signal strength.
   6        ³ Digital Mix           ³ Enables the PC Speaker input circuit.
   7        ³ Outputs Enabled       ³ Toggles the output relay accordingly.

 Switches 1 through 4 are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one can be
 active at any given time.

 Switches 5 through 7 are of type on-off and can be toggled independently.

 The text-mode user interface presents the volume settings in a familiar
 format, using sliders, as hardware analogic audio signal mixers do. You can
 change the volume of any output or input independently on the left or right
 channel, or hold down shift while pressing the left () and right () keys
 to change both channels at the same time. The sole exception is the Digital
 Mix volume slider, which can only be altered on both channels at the same
 time, regardless of the shift key status. This is because that channel is
 for monaural sound, and is hardwired to the PC Speaker input circuit.

 At any point, you can press F8 to load the default configuration, which is
 guaranteed to work with the AIF hardware. Similarly, F9 reloads the stored
 configuration from the AIF.BIN file, if available.

 If any volume or switch has been altered, upon pressing the ESC key, you are
 prompted to save the settings. Failing to do so will still initialize the
 sound card, but the settings will not persist the next time you attempt to
 initialize the sound card, using the following command.

   aif.exe -init

 Finally, pressing F10, automatically saves the settings and immediately
 exits the Mixer sub-program without any other user prompt.


 3.6 CD Player

 This section describes the CD Player sub-program. In order to use it, you
 need to install the CDROM Extensions driver. If you attempt to start the
 CD Player without the CDROM Extensions driver, an error will be displayed.

 3.6.1 CDROM Extensions

 The CD Player program communicates with the CDROM hardware through the CDROM
 Extensions interrupt 0x2F. While this interrupt is also shared with the
 Network Redirector, the CD Player sub-program will first check the presence
 of the CDROM Extensions driver via function 0x1100.

 Any other low-level CDROM hardware request will be made through the above-
 mentioned device driver.

 In short, you need to install and configure the MSCDEX.EXE CDROM Extensions
 device driver first.

 The CD Player works with both ATAPI and SCSI CDROM drives, assuming that the
 correct drivers are loaded before the MSCDEX.EXE initialization.

 3.6.2 Description

 To play audio CDs on a standard CDROM drive, you typically don't need any
 software. Most CDROM drives have physical buttons to control play, pause,
 and stop functions. Also, there is also some sort of volume control, either
 digital (buttons) or analog (dial). But the user experience is limited.

 To overcome this caveat, the CD Player sub-program was developed. The same
 familiar text-mode user interface now presents various CDROM- and audio CD-
 related information, as well as a set of commands to easily control the CD
 playback.

 To start the CD Player sub-program, type either of the following commands:

   aif.exe -cdplayer
   aif.exe -noinit -cdplayer

 The -noinit parameter is described in Section 2.4.3 Skipping Initialization,
 and it is used to run the CD Player sub-program on any machine, regardless
 what audio hardware is installed.

 The program commands, accessible via keyboard shortcuts are listed below.

   Shortcut ³ Function              ³ Description
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   F5       ³ Change Drive          ³ Specifies the CDROM drive letter.
   F6       ³ Open/Close Door       ³ Opens or closes the drive tray.
   F7       ³ Lock/Unlock Door      ³ Locks or unlocks the CDROM controls.
   F8       ³ Reset Drive           ³ Resets the CDROM hardware.
   ESC      ³ Exit                  ³ If an audio CD is already playing, it
            ³                       ³ prompts whether you want to stop the
            ³                       ³ playback, or leave it play in the
            ³                       ³ background before exitting.

 If you have multiple CDROM drives installed in the same system, then they
 can be controlled at the same time. For instance, you could have two audio
 CDs playing at the same time. To switch between CDROM drive E and drive F,
 press F5 and replace the drive letter. The CD Player will quickly recognize
 the CDROM hardware status and will act accordingly, updating the interface
 on-the-fly. Selecting a non-CDROM drive will trigger an error message.

 In some cases, depending on how the CDROM Extensions driver initialized the
 CDROM drive during computer boot, the first time you attempt to open (or
 close) the door via F6, the hardware will not respond. This happens only
 once, and in some specific cases. To overcome this issue, manually open (or
 close) the CD tray.

 The lock function applies to the physical buttons on the CDROM drive front
 pannel. If the lock is on, then the buttons don't respond to interactions.

 To easily control the playback functions, a number of keyboard shortcuts are
 provided. These are listed below.

   Shortcut ³ Function              ³ Description
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   Z        ³ [<] Previous          ³ Plays the previous track.
   X        ³ [] Play              ³ Plays the current track.
   C        ³ [ğ] Pause             ³ Pauses or resumes playback.
   V        ³ [ş] Stop              ³ Stops playback.
   B        ³ [>] Next              ³ Plays the next track.
            ³                       ³
   *        ³ Random Track          ³ Plays a random track.
   1-9      ³ Quick Play            ³ Plays a track in interval 1 to 9, if.
            ³                       ³ available on the compact disc.

 The order of the playback keys is pretty straightforward, following the
 bottom line of the keyboard (Z through B), in sequence.

 The asterisk (*) shortcut is used to playback a randomly selected track from
 the loaded compact disc.
 Quick playback keys 1 through 9 provide a faster alternative to switch to a
 specific track on the compact disc, within the first 9 tracks.

 For convenience, some additional options are included. They are described as
 follows.

   Shortcut ³ Function              ³ Description
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   E        ³ Auto Eject            ³ Ejects the disc when playback done.
   T        ³ Repeat Track          ³ Repeats current track indefinitely.
   R        ³ Repeat All            ³ Repeats all tracks indefinitely.
   V        ³ Shuffle Order         ³ Shuffles the playback order.
   B        ³ Reverse Order         ³ Reverses the playback order.

 Auto Eject is a toggle switch, and can be turned on and off independently.
 If enabled, when the audio CD finishes playback, the software automatically
 ejects the CD. If the play mode is set to repeat all tracks, then Auto Eject
 option has no effect.

 Repeat Track and Repeat All are mutually exclusive.
 Repeat All takes into consideration the playback order. If tracks are
 shuffled, reverse shuffled, or reversed, then they are repeated in that
 specific order.

 Shuffle Order and Reverse Order are mutually exclusive, but interconnected
 to some extent, as described below.
 The Shuffle Order function randomly sorts the track order with each toggle.
 The Reverse Order function inverts the track order list with each toggle.
 In addition, if the tracks are first shuffled and then Reverse Order is
 selected, the shuffled track order list is reversed as well.

 The user interface shows the selected Drive Letter, Door and Disc status,
 Track-related information, and various time data. The Track List displays
 the total tracks on the audio CD. The already played tracks are marked, the
 current track is highlighted, and the remaining tracks are unmarked.

 When all CD tracks have been played, and the repeat functions are disabled,
 then all tracks will be marked as unplayed. Until then, as long as a track
 has been even partially played, it is marked as such.

 Finally, two progress bars show the elapsed percentage of the current track,
 and the disc, as a whole.

 For the record, the UI is updated each second, and the CD Player is closely
 monitoring the CDROM hardware for changes. This means that once you start
 the CD Player sub-program and there is already an audio CD playing, it will
 pick-up the disc and current track data in real-time. You can even control
 the CDROM via the buttons on the front panel, and the software will detect
 the changes and update the UI accordingly.

 Furthermore, if the CDROM playback was manually started, and the CD Player
 program never launched, upon starting it, it will adjust the UI to reflect
 the current CD progress.

 Once the CD Player is started, it will take complete control over the CDROM
 hardware. This means that, the standard sequential track order employed by
 the CDROM drive will be overriden with the custom track order defined within
 the program (reversed or shuffled). If the order is not defined, then tracks
 will still play in sequential order, albeit in a software-controlled manner.



 4.0 Additional Information

 AIF is still evolving, and some features are still being actively developed.
 However, that is happening at a slower pace. Most of the bugs were fixed
 already, and the program is stable in most scenarios. Should you spot bugs,
 feel free to open issues on the AIF GitHub page. I will analyze them, and
 eventually, provide updates and fixes.

 For now, the PnP Setup sub-program is excluded from the compiled AIF.EXE
 file, as it is no more than an entrypoint for the upcoming fully-featured
 sub-program. However, this document states the purpose of the PnP Setup, and
 provides a glimpse of the future use-cases of this feature.
